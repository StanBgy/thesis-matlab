This is the matlab code for my Master's thesis, available here: https://github.com/StanBgy/Thesis/tree/main

This is mainly used for creating projections of our fitted variables on the cortical surface (`drawrois.m`) and doing the ANOVA tests (`anaylsis.m`). The `meshes_and_distances.m` scripts manages the computation of distances between each pairs of voxels on the cortical surface
